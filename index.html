        <p> Happy birthday!</p>
        <p> I can't even begin to express how grateful I am for everything you do for me. You always make sure I'm happy and taken care of, and your thoughtfulness and kindness warm my heart more than you know. Every moment I have with you feels so special, and the way you look out for me and ensure I'm having a good time means the world to me.</p>
        <p> It's not just the big gestures but also the little things you do, like your gentle words and the way you always seem to know exactly what I need. Thank you for being a constant source of happiness, and support to everyone in your life. I cherish you more than words can say, and my heart is always full because of you. </p>
        <p> I hope you have an amazing day today, and I wish you nothing but endless good health and happiness for another 27 years. You make life sweeter, and I adore you endlessly.</p>
        <p> Neha <3</p>
